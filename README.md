The result of the project is a robotic arm controlled by potentiometers.
Up to six different positions can be programmed. Control the arm with the potentiometers to the set position, click the button to save the position. A green LED flashes when the position is saved. When the position saving is finished, the loop with the program is started, the red LED lights up. Press the second button to stop the program.
